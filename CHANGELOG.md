## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Enterprise base OID (PEN) per connection profile** — enter your IANA Private Enterprise Number prefix (e.g. `1.3.6.1.4.1.53391`) in the connection form; object classes and attributes whose OID starts with that prefix are marked as custom. Visual breakdown in the help text explains the OID structure and links to the IANA Enterprise Numbers registry
- **Help system** — 📖 button in the toolbar (and `F1` shortcut) opens a 6-tab reference: Getting Started, Browser, Search, Schema, Import/Export, Shortcuts
- **Custom schema LDIF export** — "Export custom schema" button in the Schema Browser toolbar generates a ready-to-import LDIF file with all your custom attribute types and object classes (in dependency order). Preview the LDIF in-app, copy to clipboard or save directly to a `.ldif` file

### Fixed
- **Page size button** — `window.prompt()` is blocked in Tauri's WebView; replaced with an Ant Design Popover + InputNumber so changing the page size actually works
- **Enterprise OID validation fires too early** — `validateTrigger` changed to `onBlur` so the "invalid OID" error no longer shows while you are still typing

### Changed
- **Full English UI** — all Norwegian text in the application has been translated to English (component labels, tooltips, error messages, help text, placeholders)
- Enterprise OID field placeholder and help text now clearly explain that the PEN root (e.g. `1.3.6.1.4.1.NNNNN`) should be entered, not a deeper sub-arc; the Schema Browser banner shows the active matching pattern (`OIDs starting with prefix.*`)

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Custom schema detection** — object classes and attribute types that don't belong to known standards (X.500, inetOrgPerson, OpenLDAP, etc.) are marked with an orange `custom` badge in the Schema Browser
- **"Custom only" toggle** in the Schema Browser — filter the list to show only your own OC/AT definitions
- **Enterprise OID arc (PEN) support** — set your IANA Private Enterprise Number base OID in the connection profile; `custom` badges and the "Custom only" filter then apply exclusively to OIDs under your own arc instead of all third-party OIDs
- **PEN banner** in the Schema Browser shows the active enterprise arc when one is configured
- **Auto-suggest next OID** — a 💡 button next to the OID field in the ObjectClass and AttributeType editors automatically proposes the next available OID under your enterprise arc

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Edit saved searches** — pencil icon on each saved search opens the modal pre-filled; supports changing name, filter, base DN and scope
- **Auto-generated search name** — if you leave the name field blank when saving, a readable name is generated from the filter and base DN (e.g. `objectClass=person @ ou=Personer`)
- **DN browser button** in the save/edit search modal — browse the DIT tree to pick a base DN without typing
- Filter and base DN are now fully editable in the save/edit modal

### Fixed
- Save search (star icon) did nothing — `SaveSearchModal` was placed inside `<Splitter>` which silently ignores non-Panel children; moved outside the Splitter
- Edit saved search modal did not pre-fill values — replaced `useEffect`+`setFieldsValue` pattern with `key`-based remount and `initialValues` for reliable form population
- Production build failed after Vite 8 upgrade — `minify: "esbuild"` requires esbuild to be installed separately in Vite 8; changed to `minify: true` (uses built-in OXC minifier)
- Updated macOS build target from `safari13` (2019) to `safari15` to match Tauri 2 minimum requirements

### Changed
- **React 18 → 19**, **Vite 6 → 8**, **@vitejs/plugin-react 4 → 6** — no breaking changes in application code
- Rust patch dependency updates (wasm-bindgen, time, memchr, etc.)

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Profile name shown as a **colored badge** in the toolbar — each profile gets a stable, automatically assigned color so it is easy to tell environments apart at a glance
- Window title updates to `«Profile name» — LDAP Studio` when connected, making it easy to distinguish multiple running instances (e.g. in the macOS Dock)
- Server Info popover (ℹ) now shows profile name, host:port and active base DN
- **F5** keyboard shortcut refreshes the DIT tree; a refresh button (↺) is also available in the tree toolbar
- **Saved searches are now per connection profile** — stored in `searches-{profileId}.json`, loaded on connect and cleared on disconnect (same pattern as undo history)

### Fixed
- DIT tree did not recover after deleting an entry — the parent node now automatically reloads its children immediately after a deletion instead of leaving the tree empty

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- DIT tree now shows **all naming contexts as root nodes** — matches Apache Directory Studio behaviour; servers with multiple roots (e.g. `dc=prodreg,dc=no`, `ou=am-config`, `ou=identities`) are all visible and browsable at the same time
- Clickable naming contexts in the Server Info popover — switch the active base DN (used for search defaults) without reconnecting
- LDIF import now writes a `.log` file next to the imported file (Apache Directory Studio convention) — one line per entry with result code and error message
- `defaultNamingContext` fallback when reading rootDSE — improves compatibility with Active Directory

### Fixed
- LDIF import silently succeeded even when LDAP operations failed (rc=68 entryAlreadyExists, rc=53, etc.) — result codes are now properly checked and surfaced per entry
- LDIF import could not read files outside the app bundle — Tauri filesystem scope now covers home, downloads, desktop and documents directories
- DIT tree did not refresh after LDIF import completed
- `namingContexts` was not found on servers that return LDAP attribute names in lowercase — all rootDSE attribute lookups are now case-insensitive

### Changed
- Active base DN auto-detection now prefers `dc=` style naming contexts (domain roots) over `ou=` and other types when a server reports multiple contexts

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- White screen crash when clicking certain DIT tree nodes — React hooks were called after early returns in `EntryDetails`, violating Rules of Hooks

### Changed
- Custom SVG app icon (LDAP tree + magnifying glass with blue/indigo gradient) replaces default Tauri icon on all platforms
- Toolbar logo updated to use the same SVG icon component

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Undo/redo history per connection profile — stored locally in `undo-{profileId}.json`, survives restarts
  - Tracks: modify, delete, create, rename/move and schema changes
  - Password attributes are excluded from snapshots
  - History panel accessible from toolbar (clock icon with badge count)
- Rename / Move entry (LDAP ModifyDN) — change RDN and/or move to a new parent DN
  - Live DN preview in modal
  - DN browser button to pick new parent visually
  - Undo support
- Schema undo support — ObjectClass and AttributeType create/modify/delete are now tracked in undo history
- Keyboard shortcuts (`⌘/Ctrl+Z` undo, `⌘/Ctrl+H` history, `⌘/Ctrl+1/2/3` tabs, `⌘/Ctrl+E` edit, `⌘/Ctrl+S` save, `?` show shortcuts)
- Copy/Paste entries — copy a selected entry to an in-memory clipboard and paste it as a new entry
  - Passwords and server-generated attributes are excluded from the clipboard
  - Toolbar shows a visual indicator when clipboard is occupied (golden icon + tooltip with source DN)
  - `⌘/Ctrl+C` copies the selected entry; `⌘/Ctrl+V` opens New Entry drawer pre-filled with clipboard data
  - RDN value is intentionally left blank so the user must provide a unique value

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Native file save/open dialogs for LDIF, CSV and Excel export/import
- Last used export/import directory is persisted between sessions
- DN browser button on Base DN field in all export dialogs — browse the DIT tree visually instead of typing the DN manually

### Changed
